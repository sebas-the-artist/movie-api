                I apologize for any adult content that may have appeared. The API used does not reliably flag adult
                films,
                so I manually filtered as much as possible by banning certain titles. Despite spending far too long
                refining
                this, some mature content may have slipped through. Thank you for your understanding.
                <!-- I am so sorry that there's "adult content" that slipped through the cracks. The api i
                used doesnt mark them as adult films, Even though their mamaries are almost completely visible in some
                cases. I genuinely tried to filter them out. But i had to do it manually, Due to the api not seperating
                those from the rest of the movies. -->
                <!-- I'm not even lying i spent HOURS looking up anything remotely sexual and adding those titles to the
                "bannedTitles" const in the "displayMovies" function, Preventing them from showing up. For some reason i
                thought that was easier than finding a whole new API and restarting all my JS. -->

                I swear i'm not a weirdo, I just wanted to make a website that will show you any movie imaginable. Some
                "mature" content just so happened to get past them. I think its a language thing, because its mostly
                stuff from Asia. I'm not even lying i spent HOURS looking up anything remotely sexual and adding those
                titles to the "bannedTitles" const in the "displayMovies" function, Preventing them from showing up. For
                some reason i thought that was easier than finding a whole new API and restarting.
