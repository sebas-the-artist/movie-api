        <h3 class="sorry__para">I am so sorry that there's "adult content" that slipped through the cracks. The api i
            used doesnt mark them as adult films, Even though their mamaries are almost completely visible in some
            cases.
            I genuinely
            tried to filter them out. But i had to do it manually, Due to the api not seperating those from the rest of
            the movies.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm not even lying i spent HOURS looking up anything remotely sexual and adding those titles to the
            "bannedTitles" const in the "displayMovies" function, Preventing them from showing up. For some reason i
            thought that was easier than finding a whole new API and restarting all my JS.
            <br>
            <br>
            I swear i'm not a weirdo, I just wanted to make a website that will show you any movie imaginable. Some
            "mature" content just so happened to slip through the cracks.
